        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li>
            A majority of vision deficits are caused by age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts, glaucoma,
            myopia, and diabetes.
          </li>
          <li>
            According to estimates from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey, 23.0 million American adults between
            the ages of 18 and 64 and 9.2 million American adults 65 years and older report experiencing significant
            vision loss.
          </li>
          <li>
            These numbers are all expected to triple in prevalence over the next decade and will have a profound
            impact on the quality of life for people with vision deficits.
          </li>
          <li>
            13.4 million people â‰¥ age 60 have difficulty reading even when wearing glasses or contact lenses.
